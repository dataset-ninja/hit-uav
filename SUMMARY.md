**HIT-UAV: A High-Altitude Infrared Thermal Dataset for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-Based Object Detection** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the drone inspection domain. 

The dataset consists of 2898 images with 24899 labeled objects belonging to 5 different classes including *person*, *car*, *bicycle*, and other: *other vehicle* and *dontcare*.

Images in the HIT-UAV dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 32 (1% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (2029 images), *test* (579 images), and *val* (290 images). The dataset was released in 2023 by the Pegasus Project, China.

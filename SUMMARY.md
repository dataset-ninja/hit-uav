**HIT-UAV: A high-altitude infrared thermal dataset for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-based object detection** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the search and rescue (SAR) industry, and in the drone inspection domain. 

The dataset consists of 2898 images with 24899 labeled objects belonging to 5 different classes including *person*, *car*, *bicycle*, and other: *other vehicle* and *dontcare*.

Images in the HIT-UAV dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 32 (1% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *test* (579 images), *train* (2029 images), and *val* (290 images). The dataset was released in 2023 by the Pegasus Project, China.
